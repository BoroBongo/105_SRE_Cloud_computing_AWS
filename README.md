# Benefits of Cloud computing

## Ease of use
  
AWS is designed to allow application providers, ISVs, and vendors to quickly and securely host your applications – whether an existing application or a new SaaS-based application.

## Flexibility
  
AWS enables you to select the operating system, programming language, web application platform, database, and other services you need. With AWS, you receive a virtual environment that lets you load the software and services your application requires. This eases the migration process for existing applications while preserving options for building new solutions.

## Robustness
  
With AWS, you take advantage of a scalable, reliable, and secure global computing infrastructure, the virtual backbone of Amazon.com’s multi-billion dollar online business that has been honed for over a decade. Using AWS tools, Auto Scaling, and Elastic Load Balancing, your application can scale up or down based on demand. Backed by Amazon’s massive infrastructure, you have access to compute and storage resources when you need them.

## Cost
  
You pay only for the compute power, storage, and other resources you use, with no long-term contracts or up-front commitments. For more information on comparing the costs of other hosting alternatives with AWS, see the AWS Economics Center.

## What is SRE?

 SRE (Site Reliability Engineer) - Role within tech industry that is responsible for understanding every core feature of a service/product and ensuring it's availability and usability throughout it's entire lifecycle.

==================

## AWS Global Infrastructure

The AWS Global Cloud is the most secure,extensive and reliable cloud platform that provides you the cloud infrastructure where and when you need it with a single-digit milisecond latency.

==================

## Regions VS Availability Zones

AWS Region concept:

- Physical location around the world where we cluster data centers. Each group of logical data centers are called Availability Zone.

Availability zone

- One or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity in an AWS Region.

==================

## Four pillars of cloud computing

### Performance

- Almost unlimited scalability
- Ability to quickly add nodes/servers/offerings (hybrid/public/private)

### Security

- Both physical and virtual security
- Protection against virtual threats i.e. DDoS, Leaks etc.
- Protection against physical threats i.e. destruction of servers, natural disasters, unauthorised access to the premises etc.

### Reliability

- Every possible scenario has been taken in consideration and prepared for.
- High availability(If you can't access it when you need it most it's not highly available)

### Functionality

- Modern use cases usually require the application of multiple analytic functions working together on the same data.
